# Medical Condition Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a Tableau dashboard that explores the relationship between patient age and various medical conditions. The dashboard is based on a dataset of 10 patients, each with a set of medical conditions and corresponding ages.

## Dashboard Description
The dashboard displays the average patient age for each of the following medical conditions:

- Delayed Healing
- Itching
- Obesity Status
- Genital Thrush
- Muscle Stiffness
- Patient Irritability

The visualization reveals some interesting insights:

- Delayed healing is more prevalent in younger patients.
- There is no significant difference in patient age for itching.
- Obesity status and genital thrush do not show a significant age-related trend.
- Muscle stiffness, surprisingly, is more common in younger patients.
- Patient irritability increases with age.
